1,Inaccuracy,Run-Time,"Inaccuracy uncertainty refers to the situation in a system where there is a divergence between a measured value and its real value. This can occur in any part of the system where measurements are taken and used for decision-making or system adaptation. The divergence can be due to various factors such as measurement errors, system noise, or inaccuracies in the measurement tools or methods.","The impact of inaccuracy uncertainty is that it can lead to suboptimal decision-making and system behavior. As Self-Adaptive Systems rely on accurate measurements to make decisions and adapt, any divergence between the measured and real values can lead to decisions that are not optimal for the current state of the system. This could result in inefficient resource utilization, decreased system performance, or failure to meet system objectives.","LOW TO MEDIUM - The degree of severity of inaccuracy uncertainty can range from low to medium. It is low when these divergences occur infrequently or have a minor impact on system behavior. However, it can be medium when the system's functionality is significantly affected due to large or frequent divergences between measured and real values.","Inaccuracy uncertainty has a more profound impact on Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS) compared to non-SAS. SAS relies on accurate real-time measurements to adapt and make decisions, so inaccuracies can lead to suboptimal outcomes, affecting their effectiveness. In contrast, non-SAS operate in a static configuration, and inaccuracies in measurements, while they may affect record-keeping, do not directly influence system behavior. Therefore, while inaccuracy uncertainty is a concern in both types of systems, it is a more critical factor in the effectiveness of SAS.",To be determined,"HOGNA - The use of multiple cloud providers is mentioned in the examplar paper. Actions are performed based on the retrieved metrics. With multiple cloud providers you have multiple sources for the same metric which do not necessarily align resulting in inaccurate metrics. This could cause actions to fire too soon, too late, or be performed on the wrong instances.",,"

2,Unpredictable Environment,Run-Time,"Unpredictable Environment uncertainty originates from the dynamic and often unforeseen conditions of the system's operational surroundings. It is closely tied to the run-time phase of the system, where it interacts continuously with the environment. The unpredictability is a result of the vast array of possible environmental conditions that the system may encounter, many of which cannot be fully anticipated or enumerated during the design phase. This context of uncertainty underscores the complex and evolving nature of the environment in which the SAS operates, highlighting the challenges of managing and adapting to an ever-changing landscape of conditions and events.","Given that Self-Adaptive Systems are designed to adapt to their environment, unpredictability can pose a challenge to their core functionality. The system may struggle to interpret or respond effectively to unforeseen events or conditions, which could potentially lead to suboptimal performance or even system failures. This uncertainty can also complicate the design and implementation of the system, as it adds a layer of complexity to the decision-making processes involved in system adaptation.","MEDIUM TO HIGH - Self-Adaptive Systems are designed to adapt to their environment in real-time, making decisions based on the current state of the system and its surroundings. When the environment is unpredictable, it introduces a level of uncertainty that can challenge the system's ability to make accurate and effective adaptations. In a medium severity scenario, the unpredictable environment might lead to suboptimal performance, as the system may not adapt as effectively as it could under predictable conditions. This could result in inefficiencies, slower response times, or less than optimal decision-making. In a maximum severity scenario, the unpredictable environment could lead to system failures. If the system encounters conditions that it cannot interpret or handle, it may not be able to adapt at all, leading to a breakdown in functionality.","In evaluating the ""unpredictable environment"" uncertainty, Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS) exhibit superior performance over non-SAS due to their inherent adaptability. SAS autonomously adjust to unforeseen conditions, enhancing their performance and reliability. This adaptability negates the need for manual intervention, allowing SAS to respond effectively to environmental changes. Conversely, non-SAS rely on predefined responses and manual decision-making, which can be less efficient and more error-prone. When confronted with unexpected events, non-SAS may struggle to respond effectively, potentially leading to performance issues or system failures. Additionally, SAS can incorporate latency into their decision-making processes, further enhancing their performance and effectiveness. In contrast, non-SAS may require manual intervention to manage latency, potentially leading to delays and reduced effectiveness. In summary, SAS's inherent adaptability enables them to handle the uncertainty of an ""unpredictable environment"" more effectively than non-SAS, resulting in improved performance and reliability.","To be determined, Exceptional runtime situation, Unknown Targets, Incomparable Objectives, Time to Execute, Delayed Reaction"," AMELIA - Consider a smart transportation system that relies on real-time tracking of vehicles to optimize routes and provide timely services. Unpredictable events such as traffic congestion, accidents, road closures, or sudden changes in user demand can significantly impact the system's ability to deliver efficient services. For example, a sudden surge in demand during a major event may lead to delays and disruptions, making it challenging for the system to maintain desired service levels and meet customer expectations","DARTSIM - The mission in this context is, finding targets which are located in a remote and hostile environment. Even though both targets and threats are static, neither their number nor their location is known before the mission is started. This information can only be discovered as the team flies during the mission, and even then, with some uncertainty. If the team flies closer to the groud, they are more likely to detect the targets, but also the probability of being destroyed by a threat is higher. The higher the team flies, the lower is the the probabiity of being shot down by threats, but the less likely they are able to detect targets. The probability of a team being destroyed by threats and the probability of detecting a target can be leveraged by adaptation managers to decide how to adapt. However, in many Smart Cyber Physical Systems (sCPS), using them quantitatively are faced with the problem of trading off two measures that are incomparable in principle, the survival of the team versus the maximization of targets detected. As a result, a decision approach that favors survival may be too conservative to detect enough targets. To simulate this trade-off, DARTSim includes a more complex example that uses these performance characteristics quantitatively with the PLA-SDP self-adaptation approach.","HOGNA - When we deploy software on new instances and configure it, new instances need to have the relevant software for the experiment installed and configured properly. Therefore, many unknown situations may occur during this process. And it can be proved especially challenging if multiple clouds are involved.","K8 scalar - In a related case study, the researchers tried for evaluating the possibility to accurately compare the performance of more complex scaling policies that require parallel analysis of multiple metrics.  Three Riemann-based strategies was configured in ARBA for this purpose. In order to meet SLO1, the mean and standard deviation of the ratio of requests with a latency should be below or equal to 5%. However, unexpected occurrence happened. Across all strategies, 25\% to 45\% of the requests have a latency higher than 150 ms which makes all the three Riemann-based strategies become ineffective in guaranteeing SLO1. Therefore, it may effecting how the adaptive scaling works.","mRubis - The instantiation of  the generic simulation framework for mRUBiS for the self-healing and self-optimization is shown by providing injectors, scenarios, validators, and utility functions.This instantiation is an online marketplace where users can sell or bid on products. The 18 components that make up mRubis allow it to host any number of shops. They authenticate users, store and retrieve data from the database, and manage items, users, auctions/purchases, inventory, and user ratings. It aims at self-healing and self-optimizing. Therefore, there can be quite significant changes in terms of the utility over time. A step chart of mRUBiS's utility over time with 50 shops is shown in Figure 5a. Since the utility declines, self-adaptation does not always work.
","TAS - TAS is getting the measurements of vital parameters of the end users. Then the data is sent to the Medical Analysis Service. In case of failure, the data cannot be analyzed. If there are no analysis results, other services (i.e., Drug Service and Alarm Service) cannot be invoked. Thus, even though TAS is operating. The end user cannot receive the service as such.If the Medical Analysis Service responds, the results of the analysis could be sent to Drug Service, e.g., to get new medication or new dose of the current treatment. If Drug Service is not responding, the end user cannot receive the services related to the medication. The Alarm Service can be invoked either from TAS (based on analysis results) or by the end user. If Alarm Service is not responding, it could lead to the situation when the end user would not the able to receive the emergency ambulance treatment. Eventually, it could lead to the death of the end user.Finally, if TAS is not responding, the end user is not able to receive the service as whole. 
",
3,Incomplete Information,Run-Time,"Incomplete Information uncertainty can occur in a variety of situations where there is a lack of comprehensive data or metrics to make informed decisions or evaluations. This uncertainty is not limited to any specific domain but can arise in different contexts. For example, in the operation of any system, there may be insufficient information available to evaluate the effectiveness of various adaptation strategies. While certain metrics are commonly used for decision-making, the absence of a specific measure or dimension of data creates a gap in the available information.This uncertainty can manifest as a missing or unidentified aspect of data, which often becomes apparent during the run-time process. Whether it's due to uncollected data or unconsidered variables, the presence of ""Incomplete Information"" represents the uncertainty stemming from the absence of crucial information needed for optimal decision-making or system operation.","Without additional information, this source of uncertainty can create an unresolvable state in a Self-Adaptive System that hinders it either from detecting when adaptation is necessary, or selecting the most appropriate reconfiguration strategy.","HIGH - Without comprehensive data, this uncertainty can lead to a state in the system that is difficult to resolve. It can impede the system's ability to detect when an adaptation is necessary, as the triggers for adaptation may be based on data that is missing or incomplete. Moreover, it can also hinder the system from selecting the most appropriate reconfiguration strategy. This is because the decision-making process in Self-Adaptive System often relies on a complete understanding of the current system state and the potential impacts of different strategies. Without this information, the system may choose suboptimal strategies or fail to adapt when necessary, leading to decreased system performance or even system failures.","The uncertainty can have different impacts on the effectiveness of Self-Adaptive System (SAS) and non-SAS. In SAS, the system is designed to adapt to changing conditions and make decisions based on available data. However, when there's incomplete information, such as missing metrics on power consumption, the system might make suboptimal or even incorrect adaptations. This could lead to inefficiencies or unexpected behaviors, undermining the system's adaptability and overall performance. On the other hand, in non-SAS, decisions are typically made manually based on a comprehensive understanding of the system and its context. Incomplete information in these systems could lead to incorrect decisions or missed opportunities for optimization. However, human operators might have the advantage of using their experience or intuition to fill in the gaps in the data, potentially mitigating the impact of this uncertainty to some extent.","Unmonitorable, known unknown","HOGNA - Consider a scenario where an instance provides satisfactory status information to the monitor, but becomes unavailable for the next request due to unforeseen circumstances. In this case, the only data available to the monitor is the previous state, indicating that the instance was functioning well. The cause of the sudden unavailability remains uncertain—it could be due to network unreliability, an issue with the instance itself, or even a problem with the monitor's network. As a result, it's challenging to take decisive action with complete confidence. If the instance is experiencing an issue that could be resolved by a specific action, such as a function of the Hogna system, this corrective measure may not be triggered. This is because the problem threshold isn't reached until the instance no longer suffers from the issue, thus leading to potential delays in problem resolution.
","TAS - Take the scenario of IVS vehicles using the service with incomplete information. The system has no fixed information about various systems and environmental conditions, and it adapts inconsistently and non-specifically so that the IVS monitoring is interfered with. The velocity of the other vehicle and distance are calculated inaccurately, which leads to the collision of the vehicles.","UNDERSEA - On the initial state the UUV is equipped with 5 on-board sensors (Sensor 1 ... Sensor 5). Each sensor got the same reading rate and consume the same amount of energy per reading where only 3 sensors are needed to be turned on to satisfy the throughput requirement of minimum readings per specific distance, and also 3 is the maximum number of sensors that can be turned on to not exceed resource usage requirement. During the run-time the Sensors 1, 2 and 3 are switched on. Measurements of Sensor 1 disagree with measurements of Sensor 2 and 3 which means the inconsistency occured and the Sensor 1 is experiencing a failure. To gain right information from all operating sensors the Sensor 1 is swtiched off and the Sensor 4 is switched on as compensation to gain correct measurements.","SWIM - SWIM addresses several issues that researchers face when developing and evaluating self-adaptation approaches for web applications. But it doesn’t have a mechanism to evaluate the power cost of different self-adaptation approaches, and this introduces uncertainty in the form of inefficient and power greedy adaptations. So, by adding this feature, it gives the adaptation manager a new dimension, the power cost of all the servers. And the user can put strict maximum power threshold that the servers need to conform to, and adapt accordingly or degrade gracefully.",,,
4,Sensor Failure ,Run-Time,"Sensor Failure uncertainty arises when any sensing device or component within a system fails to capture, process, or report values accurately. This could occur due to a multitude of reasons spanning hardware malfunctions, software errors, environmental factors, or even unforeseen circumstances like power outages or physical damage. This type of uncertainty is not limited to any specific type of system and can occur in any system that relies on sensors for data collection, monitoring, control, or decision-making processes.","The impact of this source of uncertainty is significant as it can cause execution issues during run-time. A malfunctioning sensor can lead to incorrect data being fed into the system, which in turn can result in erroneous decision-making or system behavior. This can be particularly problematic in real-time systems where decisions need to be made quickly and accurately.","HIGH - Without additional information or a backup system in place, sensor failure can create an unresolvable state in a Self-Adaptive System. This can hinder the system's ability to detect when adaptation is necessary or to select the most appropriate reconfiguration strategy. The severity of the impact can vary depending on the role of the sensor in the system and the availability of backup or redundancy measures.","Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS), with their inherent ability to adapt and reconfigure in response to sensor failures, can mitigate the impact of such uncertainties more effectively. They can detect anomalies, initiate corrective actions, or switch to redundant sensors, thereby maintaining system functionality. On the contrary, non-SAS are more susceptible to execution issues during run-time and may enter an unresolvable state due to sensor failures. ","Unpredictable environment, Sensor damage, Exceptional runtime situation","AMELIA - Consider a fleet management system that relies on accurate geolocation information from IoT devices installed in vehicles. If the sensors in some vehicles produce uncertain readings, it can lead to incorrect inferences about the vehicles' positions and trajectories. This can result in inefficient routing, delay","BSN - When testing a patient’s blood glucose level, we need to take a sample of the patient’s blood in order to successfully test the patient’s blood glucose level. When the sensor is unable to obtain a valid blood sample from the patient, the sensor will continue to work, but will return a NULL value.","DRAGONFLY - Flying drones are exposed to the elements while operating. Interference from antennas present in the flying environment can cause a drone to lose communication with the base and, as a result, not be able to report its location back to the base. As such, the drone operation is hindered and it might lead to unexpected events.","DEECO - The sensor failure may occur due to unpredictable weather conditions, manufacturing flaws, aging, or improper agent interaction. In the given example scenario of self-adaptation, the goal of a vehicle is to determine available parking spaces. Assuming that a vehicle has a sensor failure but the antenna for information exchange is still available, if the network of vehicles is dense within the ensemble radius, the vehicle can still receive enough information to complete its goal. Otherwise, when the vehicle is not included in an ensemble, it receives zero information, making completing the goal impossible. In another scenario, where both the sensor and the antenna are broken, the result is not achievable either.","UNDERSEA - An AUV created by Harbin Engineering University is used as an example in the paper to illustrate sensor failures and mitigation approaches. The AUV has implemented a fault diagnosis mechanism focused on sensors affecting the vehicle's position, such as the Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), optical fiber gyroscope, location sonar, height sonar, and depth sonar. This real-time mechanism allows the AUV to complete its voyage without the risk of losing trajectory or expected positions. In the case study, Sensor 3 and Sensor 2 experience degradation in different scenarios and sometimes simultaneously. In all cases, they are replaced by Sensor 1. However, since Sensor 1 requires more energy, it is preferable for the system to work with Sensors 2 and 3. This adaptation is seen when the degraded sensor is switched off and set to recover. After recovery, the UUV is reconfigured to its initial configuration. This introduces uncertainty as the time needed for sensor recovery or repair is unknown.",,
5,Sensor Noise,Run-Time,"Sensor Noise uncertainty refers to random disturbances that occur during the process of reading, filtering, and transferring data. These disturbances introduce unpredictable variations in the sensor readings, which can lead to inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the collected data. The noise may arise from various sources, including environmental factors, electronic interference, or inherent limitations of the sensor technology.","The presence of Sensor Noise Uncertainty can significantly impact the Self-Adaptive System. It can lead to inaccurate or unreliable data, which can in turn affect the system's ability to make accurate predictions, decisions, or adaptations. This can result in suboptimal decision-making, reduced system performance, or even system failure.","HIGH - This is because the quality and reliability of the data collected by the sensors are critical for the system's performance. If the data are corrupted by noise, it can lead to incorrect decisions or actions, which can have serious consequences for the system and its objectives.","Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS) are more effective at handling Sensor Noise Uncertainty compared to non-SAS. SAS can dynamically adjust to noise disturbances, employing techniques like noise filtering or signal processing, thereby maintaining data integrity. Non-SAS, lacking such adaptability, may suffer from compromised data quality due to persistent noise. The effectiveness can be gauged by comparing data quality or system performance under noisy conditions between SAS and non-SAS. A lower rate of decision errors or system failures in SAS indicates superior handling of Sensor Noise Uncertainty.","Ambiguity, Sensor damage","PISTAR - There is an example that shows the uncertainty is the variation of the available sensors which results in lower reliability and higher cost for the whole system. In this case, the sensors would be deactivated when the battery level is less than 2%, and they would be reactivated when the battery level achieved 90%. So it's unknown for the system of the exact number of running sensors during the runtime which would result in the delay of process and the increase of processing time, that is the lower reliability and higher energy cost.",,,,,,
6,Battery Level,Run-Time,"Battery Level uncertainty refers to the unpredictability associated with the power levels of battery-operated systems. This type of uncertainty arises when the remaining battery life of a system is unknown or cannot be accurately predicted. Factors contributing to this uncertainty can include variations in battery performance, changes in system power consumption, and environmental conditions that affect battery life.","The impact of Battery Level Uncertainty on a Self-Adaptive Systems can be significant. If the battery power levels run low or deplete unexpectedly, the system's ability to execute tasks can be compromised. In the worst-case scenario, the system may be forced to terminate its operations prematurely. This can lead to suboptimal decision-making, reduced system performance, and potential system failure.","HIGH - The unpredictability of battery levels can critically impact the system's performance and reliability. An unexpected drop in battery power can drastically disrupt the system's operational capabilities, potentially leading to abrupt termination of tasks. This can result in inefficiencies, resource wastage, and missed critical operations.","A Self-Adaptive System (SAS) solution can effectively handle Battery Level Uncertainty. Compared to non-SAS solutions, a SAS can reduce the likelihood of system failure due to unexpected battery depletion. This is achieved by enabling the system to adapt and respond to changes in battery level in real-time, such as by adjusting power consumption or switching to backup power sources. A useful metric for evaluating the effectiveness of a SAS in handling Battery Level Uncertainty is the system's uptime, which should be maximized even in the face of unexpected changes in battery level.",Unpredictable Environment,"DRAGONFLY - In the example of the medical payload drone delivery application described in the paper, when the interception point detects that the drone's battery power is below the expected threshold, the drone's behavior is adapted based on the distance to the destination and the wind conditions. To enable these adaptive functions, the SAS requires devices and sensors to periodically monitor the battery level, distance to the destination, and wind conditions. Additionally, a controller is needed to convert the detected uncertainty into events and behaviors that effectively control the functioning of the adaptive system.",,,,,,
7,Effector,Run-Time,"Effector uncertainty refers to an adaptation that modifies the execution environment in ways that were not initially anticipated or planned for. This type of uncertainty arises when the system's adaptive responses, designed to optimize performance or maintain functionality, inadvertently introduce new variables or conditions that were not accounted for in the original system design or operational plan.","The unpredictable nature of the uncertainty can significantly impact the Self-Adaptive System (SAS). The system's adaptive responses, while intended to improve performance or maintain functionality, can lead to unanticipated changes in the execution environment. This can create a state that prevents the SAS from selecting the most suitable reconfiguration strategy, potentially resulting in suboptimal decision-making, reduced system performance, or even system failure.","HIGH - The unpredictability of Effector Uncertainty can have a profound impact on the system's performance. Unanticipated changes in the execution environment, triggered by the system's adaptive responses, can disrupt optimal decision-making processes and compromise system functionality. This can lead to inefficient resource allocation, hindered performance, or in extreme cases, system instability.","A Self-Adaptive System (SAS) solution can effectively handle Effector Uncertainty. Compared to non-SAS solutions, a SAS can reduce the likelihood of system congestion due to unexpected changes in the execution environment. This is achieved by enabling the system to adapt and respond to these changes in real-time. A useful metric for evaluating the effectiveness of a SAS in handling Effector Uncertainty is the average time of the trip. In the event of an unexpected change in the execution environment, this time will be lower if the change is managed with an adaptive response, as opposed to without it.","Responsiveness, Adaptive Decision Uncertainty","DELTAIOT - A facility that stores a mote needs to be renovated. All network connections get disconnected whilst this goes on. To not lose the mote while renovations are ongoing, it needs to be moved. It is uncertain what the protocols are for moving the mote and how both connectivity to the pathway and packets should be maintained.","K8SCALAR - Extensive (re)shuffling of data occurs in distributed SQL engines when more instances of a database cluster are added or removed, requiring the movement of data across existing and new database instances. This process is necessary to maintain data consistency and ensure high parallelism in query execution. However, adding or removing a database instance can significantly increase the amount of data (re)shuffling. When the algorithm triggers a scaling decision that results in increased shuffling of data across existing and new database instances, it can unexpectedly raise the cost of running the distributed SQL engine. These (re)shuffling operations involve exchanging tuples between nodes during query execution, and they contribute to the overall complexity and resource consumption of the system. Therefore, careful consideration and optimization of the data (re)shuffling process are crucial to efficiently manage the scalability and cost-effectiveness of distributed SQL engines.","LOTUS - Lotus detected violation and notify running system to perform adaption, but running system is only monitored by execution trace, which makes it hard to access the adaption and the impact on environment.","TRAPP - Let's consider the importance of avoiding congested streets as an example that highlights the challenges faced by self-adaptive systems. One major concern arises from the inability to predict or adapt to unexpected situations, such as road congestion resulting from accidents or extreme weather conditions. The effectiveness of a self-adaptive system heavily relies on its ability to respond to dynamic changes in the environment and adjust accordingly. Failure to do so can result in serious inconveniences, particularly longer travel times. ",,,
8,Network Latency,Run-Time,"Network Latency uncertainty is a universal phenomenon that refers to the delay in data transmission over a network. It is the time taken for a data packet to travel from the source to the destination. This delay can occur in any system that relies on network communication, from simple data transfer operations to complex real-time systems","Network latency can significantly affect the performance and reliability of a Self-Adaptive System (SAS). It can lead to delays in data transmission, causing the system to make decisions based on outdated information. This can result in suboptimal decision-making, decreased system efficiency, and potential failure to meet real-time requirements. In extreme cases, it could lead to system instability or failure, especially in systems where timely data is critical for operation.","MEDIUM TO HIGH - The degree of severity of the impact of network latency largely depends on the time sensitivity of the system in question. In systems where real-time data is crucial, even minimal latency can lead to significant issues. As network latency increases, the reliability of the information decreases, potentially leading to confusion and hindrance in achieving the system's goals. In less time-sensitive systems, the impact of network latency might be less severe but can still lead to inefficiencies.","To mitigate the impact of network latency, systems can implement various strategies. For instance, Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS) can adjust their adaptation strategies in real-time to account for network latency. They can also simulate and compare adaptations based on delayed data and ideal data to evaluate and improve these strategies. For non-SAS systems, it's crucial to consider all possible edge scenarios related to network latency during the requirement specification and design phases to ensure the system can handle such uncertainties effectively.",Network Delay,"DEECO - High network latency may be due to the large distance between a sender and a receiver, the number of network participants, physical obstacles, electronic interference, and other environmental factors. Given that the vehicle's goal is to find a parking spot, significant network latencies can create confusion by showing certain parking spaces as available when they have actually just been taken, and vice versa.",,,,,,
9,Network Congestion,Run-Time,"Network Congestion uncertainty can appear in any system that relies on data transmission over shared network. This issue can potentially arise in various scenarios and impact any data transmission system, encompassing servers, websites, networks, communication channels, cloud platforms, or any other medium through which data is exchanged. The unpredictability of network usage by various parties and the resulting data load can lead to congestion at any point in the network, including routers, switches, or other links.","Network congestion can have a significant impact on the performance of Self-Adaptive Systems. It can lead to packet loss, which can disrupt the communication between different components of the system, potentially causing delays or failures in the adaptation process. This could result in the system not being able to adapt to changes in its environment as quickly or effectively as it should, which could affect the system's overall performance and reliability.","MEDIUM TO HIGH - The degree of severity of network congestion can vary from medium to high, depending on the specific system and its reliance on network communication. For systems that heavily rely on network communication for their operation, the severity could be high. However, for systems that are less dependent on network communication, or have effective congestion mitigation strategies in place, the severity could be medium.","By monitoring network conditions and packet loss rates, the Self-Adaptive System (SAS) could adjust its communication strategies to minimize the impact of congestion. For example, it might prioritize essential communications over less critical ones, or adjust the timing of communications to avoid peak congestion periods. In contrast,  a non-SAS does not have these adaptive capabilities, and could therefore be more severely affected by network congestion.","Network Overload, Data Traffic Overload","ZNN.COM - Imagine the final match of the World Cup is being streamed by millions worldwide, causing a surge in internet traffic. Concurrently, a breaking news story linked to Znn.com is posted on Reddit, triggering a massive influx of users to the site. The network near Znn.com's server, already strained by the streaming of the soccer match, becomes congested. This congestion impedes Znn.com's ability to handle the sudden increase in traffic, leading to delays and failures in delivering content. As a result, many users are unable to access the news story on Znn.com, or even reach the site at all, illustrating the impact of network congestion on the performance of a self-adaptive system.",,,,,,
10,Server Failure,Run-Time,"Server Failure uncertainty is an occurrence in any system that relies on servers for its operation. It refers to the unexpected shutdown or malfunction of a server due to various reasons such as hardware malfunctions, external attacks like DDOS, heavy traffic, or human errors.  While some systems have mechanisms to manage server failure, these mechanisms may not fully address the complexity and variety of real-world server failure scenarios. Therefore, there is a need for systems to have robust strategies to simulate and adapt to server failures.","The impact of a server failure is significant and can affect various aspects of a system. Primarily, in a client-server architecture it disrupts service availability, preventing clients from making content requests or accessing services. This necessitates the system to reassign clients to a new server promptly. If not handled properly, server failure can impair the system's ability to replicate run-time conditions accurately, hindering the comparison of different approaches between runs. This can lead to data loss, service slowdown, and an inability for developers to assess how well their services will adapt to server failure.","MEDIUM TO HIGH - The degree of severity of a server failure can range from moderate to critical, depending on the extent of the failure. If a single server fails, it can result in temporary service disruption and potential business loss. However, if multiple or all servers fail, it can lead to a complete service outage, which can be catastrophic for the system and the business.
","The ability of a system to handle server failure can significantly influence its resilience and performance. In non-Self-Adaptive Systems (non-SAS), server failure often requires manual intervention, which can be time-consuming and disruptive. This could lead to significant customer loss, especially for commercial websites. On the other hand, Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS) can adapt to unexpected conditions by adjusting the server pool or the content mode, thereby minimizing the impact of server failure. In a SAS, the system should be able to automatically rectify the server failure, determine whether to replace the failed server and take measures to prevent further failures.",Server Downtime,"SWIM - The ""server failure"" uncertainty in the context of the SWIM paper refers to the unpredictable event of a server malfunctioning or becoming unavailable. This uncertainty can significantly impact the performance and reliability of self-adaptive systems (SAS). For instance, consider a web application that relies on multiple servers for load balancing. If one server fails unexpectedly, the system must adapt to redistribute the load among the remaining servers. This adaptation could involve complex decisions, such as whether to restart the failed server, replace it, or redistribute its load. The unpredictability of server failures makes them a significant source of uncertainty that SAS must be designed to handle effectively. The SWIM approach is designed to evaluate and compare different strategies for managing such uncertainties.",,,,,,
11,Inconsistency,Run-Time,"Inconsistency uncertainty emerges in real-time within systems when there are tasks or operations of varying types, sizes, and frequencies being processed concurrently. This uncertainty is not limited to any specific system but can occur in any environment where diverse tasks are handled simultaneously. It is particularly prevalent in systems that must adapt to changing conditions and demands, where the inconsistency can arise from the dynamic nature of the inputs or tasks being processed.","The impact of inconsistency uncertainty manifests in the system's adaptability being challenged by fluctuating task characteristics, leading to potential bottlenecks and reduced throughput. This uncertainty complicates task scheduling, making optimization difficult. If not properly managed, the system's reliability can be degraded, as it may struggle to meet performance objectives. Inconsistency uncertainty, therefore, directly influences a system's operational efficiency and its adaptability to changing conditions.","MEDIUM -  The uncertainty may not directly impair the overall functionality of the system, but it can significantly impact its performance and efficiency. The severity can escalate depending on the system's ability to handle diverse tasks and its tolerance for variation in task characteristics. If the system is not well-equipped to manage such inconsistencies, it could lead to bottlenecks, decreased throughput, and an overall degradation in system performance. Therefore, while it may not cause system failure, it can compromise the system's effectiveness and responsiveness, which could be critical in time-sensitive or resource-intensive applications.","In Self-Adaptive Systems, there may be parameters or schedulers that control the number of concurrently executing tasks based on the current load and task characteristics. These mechanisms can help in maintaining the system's balance between parallelism and throughput. However, in systems without such adaptive mechanisms, inconsistency uncertainty can lead to performance overheads.",Varying details,"HADOOP - In a Hadoop cluster, there can be jobs of different types and sizes. The number of jobs may not be the same all the time. As per the data size of jobs, the time of completion of the jobs varies-- jobs with larger data sizes can take longer time to complete than a job with small data sizes. In the case of running jobs concurrently, the level of difficulties may increase as the number of jobs grows. Due to these uncertainties in jobs as per size, type, and number, there can have an impact on the performance(like throughput) of a Hadoop cluster. To address this uncertainty, if a proper measure isn't applied, then it can have an impact on the reliability of SAS.",,,,,,
12,Unpredictable Wireless Interference,Run-Time,"Unpredictable Wireless Interface uncertainty arises in the context of any wireless communication system. It occurs when there's an unpredictable interference in the wireless signal, which can happen at any time during the system's operation due to a variety of factors, including physical obstructions, other electronic devices, or atmospheric conditions.","The impact of the uncertainty is significant as it can lead to disruptions in the wireless communication, including loss of data packets, decreased data transmission speed, or complete loss of connection. Depending on the system, this could disrupt a wide range of services or operations.","MEDIUM - While this uncertainty can disrupt the wireless communication, there are potential solutions and workarounds, such as changing the transmission frequency or increasing the transmission power, though they may not always be effective or efficient.","In systems without self-adaptive capabilities, manual intervention might be required to manage this uncertainty, such as changing the transmission frequency or relocating the wireless devices. However, in self-adaptive systems, the system could potentially adjust its parameters automatically to mitigate the impact of the interference.
","Noise, Risk, Unpredictable Environment ","DELTAIOT - A mote causing a wireless interference in the system. Increasing the transmission power of the mote can solve the problem but can lead to an inefficient route. On the other hand, the mote's transmission power is unrelated to the problem that's caused by some other external reason. Again SAS can create misleading adaptations.

13,Cost,Run-Time,"Cost uncertainty refers to the unpredictable variations in the operational expenses of a system throughout its lifespan. These fluctuations can be influenced by a wide range of internal and external factors. Internal factors may include changes in system components, shifts in operational strategies, or alterations in resource allocation. External factors could encompass market-driven changes in resource prices, regulatory shifts, or broader economic trends.","The unpredictability of operational costs can impose significant constraints on the adaptability and performance of a Self-Adaptive System. These cost fluctuations can affect various aspects of the system, including resource allocation, system scalability, and efficiency. The system may need to adjust its operational parameters, such as reducing resource usage or limiting scalability, to stay within budget constraints. This uncertainty also incentivizes the system to optimize resource usage and improve efficiency to mitigate the impact of cost fluctuations.","MEDIUM TO HIGH - The degree of severity of the uncertainty can range from moderate to high, depending on the extent of cost fluctuations and their impact on the system's primary objectives. Minor cost increases may lead to slight adjustments in resource usage, while substantial cost hikes could necessitate more drastic measures, such as reducing system scalability or accepting increased latency to remain within budget.","The uncertainty can have a significant impact on both Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS)  and non-SAS. Non-SAS may struggle to efficiently manage resources in response to cost fluctuations, leading to potential underutilization during periods of low demand and inadequate capacity during peak demand. In contrast, SAS have the potential to dynamically adjust resource usage in response to cost changes, reducing resource usage during low-demand periods and increasing capacity during high-demand periods to optimize performance and cost-efficiency.","Cost fluctuation, Cost of operation","SWIM - Assume the system is running with a given budget and the number of requests begins increasing. If the system has been under budget and has funds to spare, it can increase the number of servers in use to meet demand. However, if the SAS is aware that it is using as many resources as it can, given the cost and budget, it may have to instead scale back the dimmer to accommodate the increased demand. Alternatively, the SAS may ”gamble” and go over budget for a few time units, in hopes that the demand will die back down or that the costs will decrease and it will be able to ”recover” some of its losses by removing
servers after the peaks pass.",,,,,,
14,Unsatisfied Requirements,Requirements,"Unsatisfied Requirements uncertainty arises when any system fails to meet a specific requirement due to changes in its operational environment. These changes could be internal, such as alterations in system components or processes, or external, like shifts in user needs, regulatory standards, or environmental conditions.The uncertainty is inherent in any system that has defined requirements and operates in a dynamic environment where conditions can change over time. ","The impact of unsatisfied requirements can be significant, potentially compromising the system's functionality and its ability to achieve its intended goals. This can lead to partial or complete system dysfunction, rendering the system ineffective or even useless in certain cases. The degree of impact largely depends on the nature of the unfulfilled requirement and its relevance to the system's core functionality.","MEDIUM TO HIGH - The degree of severity of unsatisfied requirements can range from medium to high, depending on the nature and importance of the unfulfilled requirement. If the requirement is essential to the system's core functionality or safety, its non-fulfillment can lead to serious consequences, potentially rendering the system impractical or unreliable. On the other hand, if the requirement is not critical to the system's operation, its non-fulfillment may only result in partial loss of functionality.","The ability of a system to handle unsatisfied requirements uncertainty largely depends on its adaptability. Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS), equipped with mechanisms to adapt to unanticipated events and environmental changes, are generally more capable of addressing this type of uncertainty. They can monitor system state and property values over time, recognize potential requirement non-fulfillment, and execute mitigation strategies to meet the requirements. Non-self-adaptive systems, on the other hand, may struggle to overcome such challenges due to their lack of adaptability. The effectiveness of the mitigation strategies in ensuring system reliability and safety is a key quality metric in evaluating the system's handling of unsatisfied requirements uncertainty.","Non-compliant Requirements, Unaccomplished Requirements","DRAGONFLY - Consider a scenario where the system experiences widespread connection issues in the area, resulting in a poor connection for a certain period of time. In normal operation, the drone would initiate the ""Return to Home"" function due to the poor connection, indicating that the package delivery cannot be completed. This failure to fulfill the requirement GR1 results in an incomplete delivery. However, if the connection issue is temporary or limited to a specific location, and the drone waits for instructions, it could successfully deliver the package, thereby fulfilling the requirement. To address such extreme situations, the ""Glide"" function was developed to increase the chances of payload delivery while waiting for the connection to recover.","AMELIA - Consider a requirement that states, ""Each hospital has a taxi less than 10 minutes away."" This requirement ensures that if there is a person who needs emergency treatment and requires a taxi to reach the hospital, the taxi must arrive within 10 minutes. If this requirement is unsatisfied, patients may miss out on timely treatment, putting their lives at risk and causing a negative impact on society.",,,,,
15,Missing Requirements,Requirements,"Missing Requirements uncertainty arises when the specification of a system is not exhaustive, failing to cover all functional and non-functional criteria that the system is expected to meet during operation. This uncertainty often manifests during the requirements elicitation process, regardless of the system in question. It is a universal issue that can occur in any system where the specification is incomplete or lacks comprehensive detail.","The impact of uncertainty is significant and multifaceted. It can lead to unsatisfactory requirements, complex and difficult-to-interpret relationships between requirements, and fluctuating requirements. A system is unlikely to fulfill a requirement that it was not designed to meet, leading to suboptimal performance. Furthermore, once a requirement is identified as missing, the system specification must be updated, which can lead to additional time, effort, and potential system disruption.","HIGH - The  degree of severity of this uncertainty is high, as it can critically impair the operation of a system. A missing requirement can result in the system lacking essential inputs at its core, leading to suboptimal performance. This uncertainty can significantly affect the system's ability to function as intended.","The impact of Missing Requirements uncertainty can lead to design flaws and operational inefficiencies, as the system may not be equipped to handle unanticipated scenarios due to incomplete specifications. This can result in suboptimal performance and resource utilization. Furthermore, the need to update the system specification post-deployment to accommodate missing requirements can disrupt system operations, potentially leading to downtime and additional resource expenditure. Thus, this uncertainty can significantly compromise the adaptability and overall functionality of a system.",Incomplete requirements,"HADOOP - An improper configuration of the MARP variable can lead to a significant impact on Hadoop performance. Additionally, the proportional controller must also be adequately configured so that the Feedback control loop can maintain the MARP to hold the desired outcome of the experiment
","HOGNA - When we need to extract some metrics from the instances, the cloud providers only offer some general metrics, like the CPU utilization and number of virtual machines, whereas there are lacks of some useful metrics. Moreover, some metrics are algorithm-dependent and need custom code to handle, in this case, the missing requirements will make the algorithm cannot work and the system fail.",,,,,
16,Doubt,Requirements,"Doubt uncertainty arises when there is a concern about the validity or effectiveness of certain requirements or assumptions in a system. This can occur in any system where the effectiveness of strategies, methodologies, or assumptions is tested through experiments or real-world application. The source of this uncertainty is often the unexpected results or outcomes that challenge the initial assumptions or requirements.","The impact of uncertainty is that it can lead to a re-evaluation of the system's requirements or assumptions. This is because the unexpected outcomes challenge the initial understanding of the system's behavior, leading to doubts about the validity of the requirements or assumptions. This can affect the system's performance, reliability, or other key attributes.","HIGH - The degree of severity of uncertainty can be relatively high, as it can lead to significant changes in the system's design, operation, or performance. This is especially true if the uncertainty leads to violations of system-level objectives or requirements.","Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS) are designed with mechanisms to self-adjust in response to real-time feedback, which can be beneficial in managing the uncertainty. This adaptability allows them to respond to unexpected outcomes, potentially mitigating impacts on system performance. Conversely, non-Self-Adaptive Systems, lacking this dynamic adaptability, may require manual intervention for adjustments, which can be less efficient and potentially lead to performance degradation. Therefore, the inherent adaptability of SAS can offer a more effective response to the uncertainty.",Incomplete Requirement,"K8 SCALAR - In the paper, experiments were conducted to validate reactive scaling and support for evaluation of complex autoscaling strategies. The result shows that 25% to 45% of the requests have a latency higher than 150 ms and therefore none of strategies are effective in guaranteeing SLO1. ",,,,,,
17,Changing Requirements,Requirements,"Changing Requirements uncertainty arises when the system's goals evolve or change over time due to various factors such as environmental changes, user experience, or new functionality requirements. This type of uncertainty can also be triggered by miscommunication between system components or an incomplete system that does not fully cover all functional and non-functional requirements. It is a dynamic form of uncertainty that can emerge at any point during the system's operation, requiring the system to adapt and modify its requirements in real-time.","The impact of  uncertainty is significant as it directly affects the system's functionality and performance. Since systems are typically not designed with changing requirements in mind, they must adapt in real-time to accommodate these changes. This adaptation can lead to complex interactions between existing and new requirements, potentially compromising the system's Quality of Service (QoS) and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, changing requirements can lead to unsatisfiable requirements if the system was not initially designed to meet them. Once identified, these changing requirements necessitate modifications to the system's specifications to incorporate the new or missing requirements.","HIGH - The degree of severity for Changing Requirements uncertainty is high. While it may not directly lead to catastrophic failures or accidents, it can significantly compromise the system's mission or purpose if new goals are not recognized and addressed promptly. Therefore, the severity of this uncertainty lies somewhere between moderate and severe, depending on the specific context and the nature of the changing requirements."," The effectiveness of mitigating the Changing Requirements uncertainty hinges on a system's ability to adapt. Non-self-adaptive systems, once deployed, operate on a predefined set of requirements and lack the flexibility to accommodate changes, potentially leading to suboptimal performance or mission failure. In contrast, self-adaptive systems (SAS) are designed with mechanisms to monitor their operational context and adjust their behavior accordingly. While SAS may not directly evaluate their own requirements, their ability to respond to changes in the operational context can indirectly address the changing requirements, thereby enhancing their resilience and effectiveness in dynamic environments.","Ambiguous requirements, Requirements Interactions","UNDERSEA - In the context of the UNDERSEA system, an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) may face changing requirements due to unexpected oceanic changes or vehicle alterations. If the system does not recognize these changes, the UUV may continue to operate under the previous requirements, leading to underperformance and inefficiency. For instance, the UUV might be tasked with a new surveillance mission in a previously uncharted area. If the system fails to adapt to this new requirement, the UUV might continue its old mission, wasting resources and time. Therefore, recognizing and adapting to changing requirements is crucial for the successful operation of the UUV and the fulfillment of its mission objectives.","TAS -Take the scenario of IVS vehicles using the service with changing requirements. When the vehicle malfunctions while not maintaining the minimum distance and the control system is rebooted, the system has no instructions to deal with these changing requirements, whether to stop or keep moving until the system is back online. As such, it is uncertain how the vehicle disengaging module should behave in this situation, as both behaviors are possible.",,,,,
18,New Goal,Requirements,"New Goal uncertainty arises when the existing objectives of a Self-Adaptive System are found to be insufficient or when the system's environment or user requirements evolve, necessitating the introduction of new goals. This can occur in any system where the initial set of goals or requirements may not fully address the evolving needs or expectations of the system's users or the changing conditions of the system's environment. The new goals may require the integration of previously unanticipated services or the adaptation of the system to new targets or tasks.","The emergence of new goals can have a significant impact on the operation and performance of a Self-Adaptive System. It may lead to a situation where the current configuration of the system, such as sensor combinations in a sensor-based system, may not be well-suited to meet the new goals. This mismatch can affect the system's ability to collect relevant data or perform its tasks effectively, thereby impacting the overall research or operational process.","MEDIUM TO HIGH - The severity of the impact of new goals on a SAS can vary widely, depending on the nature of the new goals and the flexibility of the system. In extreme cases, the system may need to integrate an entirely new set of services or undergo a significant redesign to support the new requirements. This could potentially disrupt the system's functionality and require substantial resources to implement.
","Despite the challenges posed by new goals, a Self-Adaptive System (SAS) has a distinct advantage over non-SAS in handling this type of uncertainty. A SAS is designed to adapt its operations and configurations automatically in response to changes in its goals or environment. Therefore, when new research or operational objectives arise, a SAS can adjust its settings, such as sensor combinations, to better align with the new goals. This adaptability can reduce data errors, improve efficiency, and enhance the accuracy of the system's outputs. In contrast, non-self-adaptive systems may require extensive manual intervention to adjust to new goals, leading to potential inaccuracies and inefficiencies.","New requirements, Extra requirements, Changing Requirements","TAS - When an alarm is triggered, users might require the system to do more than just send an ambulance. For example, they might want a caretaker to be called upon first if they are located nearby. In this case, a new goal creates the need for integrating a new service to accomplish this.","UNDERSEA - In the process of UUV monitoring, many times the detection target will change accordingly due to the influence of external environment or internal environment changes. At this time, the sensor combination often does not fit the existing research target because of the original setup, and the returned detection data cannot meet the research requirements. Based on these detection data, the researcher may get an inaccurate conclusion of the study.",,,,,
19,Ambiguous Requirement,Requirements,"
Ambiguous Requirement uncertainty arises when system specifications, evaluation criteria, or implementation details are not explicitly defined, leading to multiple interpretations. This uncertainty can pervade any system component where requirements are open-ended or unclear. It can occur in a situation where the same requirement can be understood differently by different stakeholders, leading to potential inconsistencies in system requirements, design, and overall objectives. This uncertainty, while not confined to any specific part of the system, can manifest its effects in system development and operation, leading to potential inconsistencies and challenges.","The impact of uncertainty is significant as it can lead to unfeasible or conflicting requirements, and ultimately, the creation of a system that does not meet its intended objectives. This ambiguity can result in different interpretations by different stakeholders, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the system's design and operation. Furthermore, it can result in systems that are prone to bugs or compatibility issues due to the lack of clarity in the requirements.","MEDIUM - The degree of severity of Ambiguous Requirement uncertainty is typically medium. While it can lead to significant issues in system design and operation, the system is usually still operational and capable of change.  depending on the specific context and the extent of the ambiguity in the requirements. However, the severity can vary depending on the specific context and the extent of the ambiguity in the requirements.","Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS) effectively manage ambiguous requirements by adjusting their behavior during runtime. They recognize multiple interpretations of a requirement and adapt to align with the most suitable one. This adaptability mitigates design inconsistencies, bugs, or failure to meet objectives that often result from ambiguous requirements in traditional systems. In contrast to SAS, non-SAS struggle with ambiguous requirements, as they can't dynamically interpret or adapt to them. This rigidity can lead to design inconsistencies, bugs, or failure to meet objectives.","Lack of specificity, Vague Requirement","TRAPP - As a sample illustration, we can present R5 and R6 that don't contain exact metrics and different people who work on the system will interpret them in different ways. ","HOGNA - If the analyze component needs to derive a custom performance model, the planning component will fail if the model contains unexpected conditions that are not included in the planning component, such as excessive CPU utilization.",,,,,
20,Application and Database Variation,Requirements,"Application and Database Variation uncertainty arises from the variability in the applications and databases used in a system. Different applications have different requirements and use cases, leading to variations in how they interact with the system. Similarly, databases can vary in their structure and functionality, such as SQL, OLTP, OLAP, etc., leading to differences in how data is stored, accessed, and managed. This variability can introduce uncertainty in the system's performance and behavior.","The variation in applications and databases can impact the implementation and operation of the system. Depending on the specific application or database in use, the system may need to adapt its processes and operations to accommodate these variations. This could lead to changes in the system's functionality, performance, and resource usage.
","MEDIUM TO HIGH - The severity of this uncertainty can vary widely depending on the extent of the application and database variation. In some cases, the system may need to significantly alter its operations, such as changing the proportion of read and write requests. In other cases, the system may need to reassess critical points and adjust its configuration to ensure optimal performance and resource usage.","The uncertainty stemming from application and database variation can significantly impact a system's operation and performance. Self-adaptive systems (SAS) can effectively manage this uncertainty by adapting to the varying requirements and use cases of different applications and databases. By dynamically adjusting its operations, such as read/write request patterns, a SAS can maintain optimal performance and efficient resource usage. In contrast, non-adaptive systems may struggle to accommodate these variations, potentially leading to inefficiencies, incorrect scaling, and wasted resources. Thus, the use of SAS can ensure judicious resource allocation and robust performance in the face of application and database variation.",Varying use-case scenarios,"K8SCALAR - Consider a system where the application's nature dictates the database requests. In the case of a Learning Management as a Service (LMaaS) application, the system predominantly makes write requests (95%) to the Cassandra database, with only a small fraction (5%) being read requests. However, if the system were servicing a video streaming application, the nature of requests would shift dramatically towards read-intensive operations. The autoscaling parameters would need to be adjusted accordingly to accommodate these differing use-case scenarios, illustrating the impact of application and database variation on system operations.",,,,,,
21,Risk,Design,"Risk refers to the uncertainty surrounding the potential negative consequences or effects of an activity on various aspects that humans value, such as healthcare, property, or the environment. In the case of a Self-Adaptive System, design risks arise from the uncertainty related to the impact of different factors on the system's performance. Risk assessment at the design level is a crucial risk management activity that aims to reduce uncertainty during the design process or product development, thereby minimizing the probability of hazards or losses.","Risk encompasses any situation that exposes the system to potential dangers. In the context of a self-adaptive system, there is a possibility that improper design decisions can lead to adverse outcomes. The improper design may result in the system lacking necessary functional requirements or implementing them incorrectly, which can have repercussions during execution. Since a self-adaptive system relies on its own execution to address uncertainties, it may not always find the most optimal solution to overcome obstacles, especially in dangerous situations. This increases the significance of addressing this uncertainty appropriately.","HIGH - The severity of design-related risk is typically high, as it directly influences the system's performance and reliability. The consequences can range from minor operational inefficiencies to catastrophic system failures, depending on the system's complexity and the environment it operates in. Therefore, addressing this uncertainty is crucial to ensure the system's robustness and resilience.","A self-adaptive system (SAS) possesses the capability to employ adaptive techniques by assessing environmental and system variables, enabling it to make informed decisions and adapt accordingly. It effectively addresses risks during flight if the associated uncertainties are appropriately managed. In contrast, a non-self-adaptive system lacks the ability to adapt and adjust its behavior in response to environmental changes. For instance, in the presence of strong winds, a non-self-adaptive system would be unable to modify its instructions and would continue flying towards its destination, leading to potential failures, deviations from the intended path, package loss, and damage. Consequently, it becomes evident that a SAS can execute a safe landing, ensuring the preservation of the package and the drone, while a non-SAS entity remains unable to alter its precarious situation. The solutions implemented to address this type of uncertainty are vital in ensuring the safety and functional operability of the drone.",Danger,"DRAGONFLY - To illustrate this risk in the context of our system, let's consider a scenario where the drone's battery level is low, but it still has sufficient time to reach its final destination. This situation creates a hazardous condition where the battery might deplete during flight, potentially causing the drone to break or fail to deliver the package. The lack of battery power and inability to communicate its location to the pilot's device pose significant risks, as both the drone and the payload become vulnerable to damage or loss. Consequently, the ""Safe Landing"" functionality is introduced. Furthermore, extreme circumstances, such as flying over water, present additional dangers as damage or loss could occur, making it challenging to locate the submerged drone. Additionally, strong winds can cause severe harm to both the device and the payload, necessitating the implementation of the ""Move Aside"" functionality. These scenarios address and mitigate the risks associated with this uncertainty, ensuring the safety of both the product and the drone. Meeting global requirement 2 (GR2) is crucial in this regard.",,,,,,
22,Misinformed Tradeoff Analysis,Design,"Misinformed Tradeoff Analysis uncertainty arises when design decisions are made based on misguided and subjective preferences. It occurs in systems where there is a lack of complete or accurate information, leading to decisions that may not reflect the optimal trade-offs. This is particularly prevalent in complex systems where various components or subsystems interact in intricate ways, making it challenging to fully understand the implications of design choices.
","The impact of the uncertainty can lead to suboptimal or inefficient system performance. This could manifest in various ways depending on the system, such as increased resource consumption, loss of data, or decreased system efficiency.","HIGH - The severity of this type of uncertainty is high because it directly affects the decision-making process, which in turn can significantly impact the performance and efficiency of the system.","In non-Self-Adaptive Systems, this type of uncertainty can only be mitigated through manual intervention, such as system administrators making adjustments based on their understanding of the system. In contrast, Self-Adaptive Systems can potentially mitigate this uncertainty by continuously collecting data about the system state and behavior, and using this information to adapt and optimize system performance.","Unexpected Management Choices, Partial Knowledge Uncertainty",DELTAIOT - A mote has more than one parent link getting the same packets. On mote spending more energy and less stable compared to the other. We should only use the other one for reaching the gateway. SAS cannot choose one over the other because the missing information over the subnets.,,,,,,
23,Inadequate Design,Design,"Inadequate design refers to the situation where a system's design does not fully satisfy the stated requirements or includes latent, unexpected behaviors. This can occur due to various constraints such as limited resources, time, or financial budget, which can lead to oversights or compromises in the design process. The design may not fully account for the complexity of the system's operational environment or the range of scenarios the system might encounter, leading to a design that is not robust or flexible enough to handle these situations effectively.","Inadequate design can lead to significant system errors and deviations from intended functionality. It can result in a flawed system architecture, preventing the system from meeting its requirements. This can compromise the system's adaptability, affecting its ability to respond to changes in its environment or operational conditions, thereby impacting overall performance and goal achievement.","HIGH - The severity of this source of uncertainty is typically high. An inadequate design can seriously impact the functionality of a system, hindering its operation and preventing it from performing necessary actions or adaptations. This can endanger the completion of its goals and compromise its overall performance.","Self-adaptive systems, with their inherent ability to adjust behavior based on changing requirements, are typically more resilient to this uncertainty. In contrast, non-self-adaptive systems, lacking this flexibility, may struggle to meet evolving requirements, thereby failing to mitigate the impacts of inadequate design.",Incomplete Design,"DRAGONFLY - A crucial aspect of a drone-based SAS system is the ability to adapt drone behavior based on events occurring in the system's context and environment. Specifically, the system should be designed to ensure that all defined requirements are satisfied and that no previously unobserved behavior emerges. However, the use of aspect-oriented programming to facilitate the alteration of drone behavior when facing exceptional environmental situations introduces challenges to the completeness of the system design. For example, an aspect that overrides a drone's behavior and instructs it to move aside when specific environmental conditions occur could potentially violate the drone's local safety requirement of maintaining a safe distance from other objects in its environment. Consequently, property damage could occur, such as in the case of a collision between drones. Such an inadequate design, which leads to the violation of system requirements, results in reduced safety and reliability of the SAS system.","K8SCALAR - The 'K8-Scalar' paper posits that without comprehensive design requirements, the system's underlying behavior may not fully satisfy or encompass the intended behavior, and high-level Service Level Objectives (SLOs) may not map accurately to resource metrics. To prevent SLO violations using resource-level metrics, the paper details experiments conducted to find correlations between Quality of Service (QoS) metrics and resource-level metrics. This experimental design aims to enhance the reliability of the Self-Adaptive System (SAS) and provide additional flexibility for system operations.","TAS - Take the scenario of IVS vehicles using the service with inadequate decision. The adaptive control design of McUmber and Cheng cruise is based on the minimum distance standards set by industry. Reusing this design leads to reduce implementation efforts but also means that other designs are not explored such as in another design, the minimum safe distance between the IVS and another vehicle can be increased which reduces the propability of collision.

24,Unexplored Alternatives,Design,"Unexplored Alternative uncertainty occurs when developers, restricted by time, budget, or other resources, find themselves unable or not ready to think about every possible design and the necessary trade-offs to meet a particular set of needs. This issue often crops up due to a variety of practical hurdles, making it difficult to fully probe all likely development paths. As a result, the key issue that arises is the lack of exploration of all design alternatives. This lack of exploration becomes the root cause of the uncertainty, potentially affecting the overall quality of the final product","The impact of this uncertainty can be significant. It can lead to a system design that is sub-optimal and fails to satisfy all functional and non-functional requirements. This can result in latent behaviors, inefficiencies, and ineffective resource management. In some cases, it can also lead to security concerns or impede effective system management.","MEDIUM - While the system can still function as designed, it may fail to satisfy its global requirements in certain special cases. This can lead to the need for additional functionalities or adjustments to be made.","Unexplored Alternatives uncertainty can significantly impact both self-adaptive and non-self-adaptive systems. However, self-adaptive systems can better manage this uncertainty by dynamically adjusting to demands, enhancing performance and throughput. They can identify more scenarios, making the system more operable and fault-tolerant. In contrast, non-self-adaptive systems, lacking these corrective measures, may become idle or underperform in certain scenarios, leading to potential losses. Therefore, self-adaptive systems generally exhibit superior effectiveness in handling Unexplored Alternatives uncertainty.",To be determined,"DRAGONFLY - Consider a scenario in which the drone's battery is low, and it is flying above water. Depending on the weather conditions and the presence or absence of strong winds, Wrapper 1 will call either the ""Safe Landing"" method or the ""Move Aside"" method. However, the system lacks functionality to handle the aftermath of this process. To ensure the delivery of the product according to GR1 and maintain the safety of both the product and the drone as per GR2, an additional Wrapper 4 is implemented, which invokes the NoneBoatWrapper. When a safe landing is executed, this wrapper ensures that a boat reaches the drone to catch it, preventing any loss to the product. Subsequently, the boat delivers the drone and the product to the specified destinations before returning to its source.","HOGNA - In the context of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, the uncertainty can manifest when not all potential mitigation strategies are considered. For instance, a system might be designed to drop or redirect some requests as a countermeasure. However, other effective strategies such as rate limiting, IP filtering, or deploying additional resources might not be explored due to constraints or lack of foresight. This could lead to sub-optimal performance or even system failure under intense DoS attacks, highlighting the importance of considering all possible alternatives during the design phase.","MRUBIS - In the mRUBiS project, developers created a basic self-healing and self-optimization framework, focusing on a limited set of scenarios. While this approach was beneficial for early testing and small-scale projects, it overlooked alternative design solutions for larger, real-world environments. The utility function computation, environment model support, and evaluation metrics also need enhancement. The design, primarily tested on Java 8 and Ubuntu 16.04, requires thorough testing on varied technologies to prevent accidental adaptive solutions and catastrophic outcomes.

25,Adaptation Tactic Latency,Design,"Adaptation Tactic Latency uncertainty arises during the execution of adaptation strategies in self-adaptive systems. This inherent delay, influenced by factors such as the complexity of the tactic, the system's current state, and its operational environment, holds significant relevance in the design phase. It has the potential to significantly impact system performance, particularly in real-time response systems where any delay can lead to suboptimal results or even system failures. Therefore, accounting for this latency during the design stage can greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.","The latency in executing adaptation tactics can significantly impact the performance and effectiveness of a self-adaptive system.

For instance, in systems where real-time response is critical, such as autonomous vehicles or high-frequency trading systems, latency can lead to suboptimal performance or even system failures. In other contexts, such as cloud computing or data processing systems, latency can result in violations of service level agreements or inefficient resource utilization.","MEDIUM TO HIGH - The severity of the impact of Adaptation Tactic Latency can range from intermediate performance degradation to catastrophic system failure, depending on the system's operational context and the nature of its adaptation tactics. In systems where timely response is critical, the severity can be high, potentially leading to system shutdown or mission failure. In other contexts, the severity might be lower but can still result in significant performance degradation or inefficiencies.","The effectiveness of a Self-adaptive system in managing Adaptation Tactic Latency depends on several factors. These include the system's ability to anticipate and plan for latency, the speed at which it can execute adaptation tactics, and the system's overall design and operational context. In general, systems that can anticipate and plan for latency, and execute adaptation tactics quickly, are more effective in managing this uncertainty. However, the effectiveness can also be influenced by external factors, such as the need for manual intervention or the system's operational environment.

This type of uncertainty is not confined to a specific technology or platform, making it a prevalent issue across various system deployments. It's particularly significant in systems that require frequent scaling or redeployment, where the cumulative impact of this overhead can significantly affect overall system performance and efficiency.","Deployment overhead can lead to increased computational time, resource usage, and potential system downtime. This can affect the system's runtime performance, causing delays in execution, increased operational costs, and potential service disruptions.","LOW TO MEDIUM - The severity of this uncertainty is generally low to moderate, as deployment is an inevitable part of system operation. While it can introduce overhead, this process is typically optimized to minimize disruption and delay","Self-Adaptive Systems effectively manage deployment overhead by dynamically adjusting to changes and optimizing resource allocation. They offer advantages such as improved efficiency, reduced downtime, and better resource utilization. Despite the complexity of their implementation, their ability to autonomously adapt to varying conditions makes them a robust solution for managing deployment-related uncertainties in a wide range of system deployments.","Risk, Inadequate Design","HADOOP - In the context of the Hadoop-benchmark platform, the creation of virtual machines introduces an overhead. This overhead, however, is a necessary part of evaluating the self-adaptive behavior of Hadoop clusters. Without self-adaptive systems (SAS), the creation of reproducible Hadoop environments would require a manual approach. This manual process can be complex, requiring specific knowledge and significant effort. By leveraging SAS, the complexity is managed, and the overhead associated with creating virtual machines is minimized, enhancing the efficiency and reproducibility of Hadoop environments.",,,,,,
28,Future Parameter Value,Design,"Future Parametar Value uncertainty arises when system parameters, used in formulating predictive models or decision-making algorithms, are subject to change over time due to internal or external factors. These parameters could be intrinsic system properties or external conditions that are unpredictable or beyond the control of the system. This uncertainty is inherent in dynamic environments where system behavior and performance are influenced by evolving conditions, making it challenging to accurately predict future parameter values",The unawareness of system internal properties (e.g. reliability) fluctuations due to context changes impacts the correctness of estimated target properties values (reliability in this case) and thus leads to a slow recovering speed. This means the managing system has a latency in identifying and reacting to potential problems. This makes it more difficult and slower to converge the actual target property values to the adaptive goals defined in the policies.,"LOW - This uncertainty primarily affects the efficiency of system functionalities rather than causing outright failure. It leads to slower system responses and performance degradation, but it doesn't typically result in complete system breakdown or loss of functionality.","Unlike non-SAS, which suffers from reliability drift and slow recovery, SAS swiftly identifies and reacts to potential problems, minimizing latency. This adaptability not only enhances system reliability but also optimizes cost, demonstrating the system's resilience to uncertainty and its ability to maintain efficient operation in the face of unforeseen environmental and system value changes.",Unpredictable Environment and System Value,"PISTAR - An example in the context of the Body Sensor Network is degrading task reliability due to an unexpected number of patients.  Normally, the messages are waiting to be read by the central hub and then system goals can be evaluated. But in this scenario, they are blocked in the hub’s communication channel. The reliability decreases because of the message processing delay. ",,,,,,
29,Insufficient Simulation Dynamics,Design,"Insufficient Simulation Dynamics uncertainty arises when a system relies on simulations to model complex real-world dynamics, as the simulation may not fully capture all the structured behaviors present in the actual system. This could be due to limitations in the simulation design, lack of data, or the inherent complexity of the real-world system. This is not limited to physical systems but extends to any system where simulations are used, including economic models, weather forecasting, traffic systems, and more.","The insufficiency of simulation dynamics can lead to significant inaccuracies in the system's performance predictions. These inaccuracies can be quantified and may reveal structural patterns in the nature of the error. When the error exceeds expected boundaries and has a sufficient structure that it can be modeled, it indicates that the simulation is missing significant dynamics present in the real-world system. This could lead to suboptimal decisions or actions based on the simulation results.","HIGH - The severity is due to the potential for significant inaccuracies in the system's performance predictions, which could lead to suboptimal or even detrimental decisions or actions. The severity is further heightened if the system is used for critical applications where inaccuracies could have significant consequences.","The effectiveness of managing uncertainty through self-adaptation is highly dependent on the specific system and its dynamics. However, generally, self-adaptive systems can better handle uncertainties by dynamically adjusting to changing conditions and learning from previous experiences. This adaptability can lead to improved accuracy and performance over time, as the system becomes more aligned with the real-world dynamics it is trying to simulate. Furthermore, self-adaptation can potentially reduce the severity of errors and their impacts, making the system more robust and reliable. Therefore, despite the complexities involved, the benefits of self-adaptation in managing uncertainties are significant and can enhance the overall effectiveness of the system","Cyber-Physical Gap, Reality Gap ","CROWDNAV - Real-world traffic densities exhibit structured, time-dependent patterns, often referred to as 'seasonalities.' These patterns, which recur periodically (with 24-hour intervals being the most common), are well-documented and extensively studied. However, in the case of self-adaptive systems like CrowdNav, the traffic simulation operates with a constant traffic volume, devoid of this temporal component. This lack of temporal variation leads to a significant divergence from real-world patterns. Consequently, it results in the selection of inadequate routing models and adaptive parameters, which may perform well in the simulation but fail to deliver optimal results in actual deployments. Therefore, the absence of temporal dynamics in the simulation introduces a significant source of uncertainty, affecting the system's overall effectiveness and reliability.",,,,,,
30,Wrong Operation Sequence,Design,"Wrong Operation Sequence uncertainty arises during the design phase of a system, when requirements are being translated into the system's architecture and operational workflow. It can occur in any system where there is a complex sequence of operations or processes that need to be executed in a specific order. The sources of this uncertainty can include lack of effective communication between different teams (such as business and development teams), incomplete or unclear requirements, or unverified design elements that allow for unplanned or latent behaviors.","The impact of this uncertainty can be significant, leading to incorrect sequences of operations. This could mean that certain processes are invoked without all prerequisites being met, certain processes are not invoked when they should be, or a single operation triggers multiple processes instead of the intended one. The exact impact can vary widely depending on the specific system and the nature of the operations involved.","MEDIUM - The severity of this uncertainty is considered medium because it can lead to system behaviors that deviate from the intended design. However, the exact degree of severity can depend on the specific system and the potential consequences of the wrong operation sequence. For instance, in a system where operations are safety-critical, the severity could be high.","In a non-self-adaptive system, wrong operation sequences can lead to the system operating in a non-desired manner, potentially causing significant problems or failures. In self-adaptive systems, these incorrect sequences may be detected and corrected during runtime, mitigating the impact of this uncertainty. However, this depends on the system's ability to adapt and correct itself, and the effectiveness of these mechanisms in practice.","Workflow Misconfiguration, Operational Flow Disruption","TAS - The TAS system uses input profiles to execute specific sequences of service invocations, with each invocation associated with predefined workflow variables. Uncertainty can arise from the probabilistic selection of workflow branches. ReSeP probes monitor these invocations and their costs, tracking the start and completion of workflows. ReSeP effectors allow dynamic updates to workflow parameters and architecture. An adaptation engine leverages these probes and effectors to track and adapt system behavior dynamically, mitigating the impact of uncertainty but also introducing potential new sources of uncertainty in the adaptation process.",,,,,,
